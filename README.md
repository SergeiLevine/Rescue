## Megilot Search&Rescue

We are a team of developers that bring you the next search and rescue application for the Israeli police force volunteer unit!
Our app will help the police volunteer team to rescue people from harsh places and get backup as quickly as possible.
Our app includes two interfaces, a PC side software for the event commander and a mobile app for all the volunteers participating in the current event.
